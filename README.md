This repository does contain Pine scripts which can be used on Tradingview.com.

Indicators ("study" in Pine terms) use the prefix TFi; strategies use the prefix TFs.

These are only simple indicators and strategies. Please contact me via Upwork (https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01e7a1b7a2edd4853a/) or info@tradefab.com for further scripts or projects.
